# Raspberry Pi Time-Lapse
This code enables a raspberry pi (with a Raspberry Pi Camera attached) to take a picture every 20 seconds while robotics practice is going on at the New Buffalo Steam building.  By using the Raspberry Pi's IP address on port 8000, you can access any photos that have been taken.
